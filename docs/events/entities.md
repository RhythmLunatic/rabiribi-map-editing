# Entities

Entities are generally objects you can interact with in-game. This includes things like:
- Enemies
- Bosses
- Springs / Computer Desks
- NPCs

Entities have IDs in the 1000+ range.

## Entity IDs and Types
Each Entity has an Entity ID and a Type.

For example, a bunny enemy (the first enemy you see in starting forest) has entity ID 1096.
- Entity ID 1096 with Type 0 is a small bunny enemy.
- Entity ID 1096 with Type 5 is a big bunny enemy. (seen near Cocoa1's boss fight)
- Entity ID 1096 with type 6/7 are huge bunny enemies (seen in night forest)

## Entity Events
The Event ID that spawns an entity is the same as the entity ID itself. Because Entity IDs are in the 1000+ range, they do not conflict with other event types. Thus placing an event with ID 1096 on the map will spawn a small bunny there.

If you want an entity of type k, place a "type specifier" event above the entity. The type specifier event has an ID of 5000+k.

For example, to place a Type 5 Bunny on the map, you place an event with ID 1096, and an event with ID 5005 just above it.

```
+----+
|5005|
|----|
|1096|
+----+
```

If no type specifier event is used for the entity, the entity defaults to Type 0.

# Direction Modifiers

If an entity uses direction modifiers, then use these events as modifiers instead:
- Right: `195`
- Left: `196`
- Up: `198`
- Down: `199`

Direction modifiers can be used along with type modifiers if you place the direction modifier in the event stack.

**Note:** If an NPC walks into a left/right Direction Modifier tile, the NPC immediately turns to face that direction. This can be used to prevent NPCs from walking off ledges.

# Entity List

Names based off -debugshowevents tile names.

Boss NPCs are included in the list but I only tested Rita and Pandora due to them having shadow clone events.
Any boss NPC can be activated by other boss events, allowing for double boss encounters. Defeating any of them will exit boss mode, however.

If the entity is not listed here, it just spawns in an Erina. Usually a small one.
